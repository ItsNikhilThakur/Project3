Weekly Assessment:
You will create a personal portfolio website that showcases your skills, projects, and contact details. The website should consist of:
Home Page: A welcome section with an introduction.
About Page: A biography with professional details.
Portfolio Page: A grid-based layout showcasing projects.
Contact Page: A form with fields for name, email, and message.
Each page must use CSS3 selectors, colors, shadows, and styling techniques effectively.
App Requirements:
1. Apply CSS3 Selectors Effectively
Use relational selectors (>, +, ~) to target elements efficiently.
Implement attribute selectors (e.g., input[type="text"] {}) to style form fields.
Apply pseudo-classes (:hover, :focus, :nth-child()) to enhance interactivity.
2. Implement CSS3 Colors & Transparency
Use RGBA colors for dynamic background effects.
Apply HSL or HSLA color models for creative color schemes.
Implement opacity to create transparent backgrounds or overlays.
3. Design with Rounded Corners & Shadows
Use border-radius for rounded profile pictures and buttons.
Apply box-shadow for modern card-based layouts.
Implement inset shadows for interactive depth effects.
Use text-shadow for stylish typography.
Additional Enhancements (Bonus Points ðŸŽ¯)
Create a hover effect where portfolio cards expand slightly.
Use :nth-child() to apply alternating row colors in project grids.
Add a "dark mode" toggle using CSS variables and pseudo-classes.
